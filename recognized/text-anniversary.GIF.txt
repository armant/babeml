On a day of great celebration and joy, on the          day        
of the week, the    day of the month of                           
in the year two thousand    which corresponds                     
to the day of the month of    in the year five                    
thousand seven hundred and    the holy Covenant                   
of Marriage was entered into between the bride,                   
, and the groom,    . We                                          
joined in holy matrimony and promised to share our lives          
in times of trouble and in times of joy, to talk and to listen,   
to honor and sustain, to nourish and treasure, to provide for     
and support each other in trust and in love. We vowed to          
give and receive love with open hearts and fulfill each other's   
uniqueness with integrity. With this ketubah, we today            
reaffirm our commitment to create a home, for us and for our      
children, based on love and on traditions of our heritage.        
May we grow, our lives forever intertwined, our                   
love bringing us closer. May compassion, integrity and            
forgiveness continue to bless our home and make                   
our union ever stronger. As we joyfully entered into this         
covenant of marriage    years ago today, so may                   
we continue in our life’s journey and share the blessings of      
hope, peace and love today and all the days of our lives.
